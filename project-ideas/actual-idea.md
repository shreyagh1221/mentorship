# IDEA: Website that can match people
## Target users
- Folks in the workplace who need to schedule meetings, shifts, etc. For example, retail managers, bosses, employers
## Problem it solves
- It is often difficult and inconvenient for employers to have to create employee shifts/meetings with the employee's schedules in mind (as people have extremely different lives outside of work). In order to reduce this inconvenience while still keeping employee happiness in mind, this application will cmatch employee schedules without the employer having to do much work  
## Current Application
- Website algorithm matches schedules to create meetings with minimal human intervention
## Potential future applications
-Website algorithm can also take in "long answers" (ex: employees can write preferences) which influence meeting creation
