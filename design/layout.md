  - Employees tab would consist of all the employee names. If the name is clicked on, it brings up information about that specific employee (ex: their shifts, wage, age, etc). This information is inputted by the employee when they join, not the employer. 
  At the bottom of this page is a "plus sign" where they can "invite" new employees.

  meetings that have occured, upcoming meetinngs are meetings within the next two week, and far in the future meetings are meetings occuring after the next two weeks.
  Under each meeting is infomration about it: time period, who attended, purpose. Employer can create a meeting by clicking "create meeting" at the bottom of the page. 
  Then they have the drop down option as to HOW SOON they want the meeting to occur (next week, next month).
  - Notifications: Here, the employer will recieves alerts about the meetings/from the employee. (ex: employee can't attend for some emergency reason, meeting in progress,
  meeting ended)
  
## employee side
- TABS: personal, meetings
  - personal tab consists of information about the employee. When they join this website, they will prompted to fill this out. They will also be prompted to add their schedule.
  There are two options: manually, or by syncing google calenders. If they choose manual, they will get drop down options for availability (days, times).
  Here they will also have an invite box, where they'll recieve invites to be a part of the employers "group" and get meeting notifs from them.
  - meeting tabs consists of three sections: past meetings, upcoming meetings, and very far in the future meetings. Employees only have the option to attend the meeting
  or "flag" the meeting. They cannot create them. "Flagging" a meeting indicates that even though their schedule matches up for the meeting, they cannot attend due to some
  emergency (injury, etc). For upcoming/far in the future meetings, they all have a little flag in the corner. If an employee clicks on this flag, they will be prompted to add a
  message saying why they flagged it (may be optional, depending on employer preference). The flag and message show up in the employer inbox.
